# Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
I am an aspiring Data Scientist showcasing my deep learning journey.  
This repository contains structured projects where I experiment with different architectures and datasets.  
I update this repository regularly to demonstrate consistency and growth in applied deep learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

1. **MNIST Baseline & Preprocessing**  
   - Built baseline dense NN on MNIST dataset  
   - Explored normalization, reshaping, and evaluation metrics  

2. **LeNet on MNIST**  
   - Implemented classic LeNet-5 CNN  
   - Achieved high accuracy on digit classification
     
3. **AlexNet**
